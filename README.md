## Viewing the App

In order to view the app, you will need to do several things:

- Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- Update bios to allow for Kernal Virtual Machines. This allows you to do Virtual Machines on your computer and is needed if you want to test the app on your computer.
- Download an image of one of the Andriod OS. We used Pixel XL API 30, but if you have an android phone you can view and use the app from their.
- Clone this repo using git.

Once you open the andriod studio project, then you should be able to run it after Andriod Studio configures to the packages needed for this project.
