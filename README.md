## Free Your Time

This is an android app that was developed by Group 1 for ECS 164 Winter Quarter of 2023 at UC Davis. The purpose of this project was to develop a product prototype using the HCI design methods we learned in ECS 164. This is our final attempt at a High Fidelity Prototype. This project tries to solve student's feeling that they lack free time by creating an android calendar app that shows times that an user has available each day, as well as show average amounts of free time for each week. Because this is a prototype, there may be bugs or missing features from a final product, so please keep this in mind while using the app.

## Developers

- Matthew Schulz <mkschulz@ucdavis.edu>,
- Conar Abramson-Davis <cabramsondavis@ucdavis.edu>
- Sage Zimmerman <sazimmerman@ucdavis.edu>
- Bradly Booth <btbooth@ucdavis.edu>
- Jared Pugh <jpugh@ucdavis.edu>
- Sarah Wu <ssjuw@ucdavis.edu>

## Viewing the App

In order to view the app, you will need to do several things:

- Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- Update bios to allow for Kernal Virtual Machines. This allows you to do Virtual Machines on your computer and is needed if you want to test the app on your computer.
- Download an image of one of the Andriod OS. We used Pixel XL API 30, but if you have an android phone you can view and use the app from their.
- Clone this repo using git.

Once you open the andriod studio project, then you should be able to run it after Andriod Studio configures to the packages needed for this project.
